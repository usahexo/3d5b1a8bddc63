<p>The Ottawa Citizen broke the story this morning, alleging that while Karlsson was in London attending a movie premiere with his then-girlfriend (now wife), he was asked by the producers of Casino Royale to take on a small acting role.</p>
<p>Karlsson is said to have landed the part of Vesper Lynd’s bodyguard, and can be seen briefly during the climactic casino scene.</p>
<p>When reached for comment, Karlsson’s agent had no comment on the report.</p>
<p>Karlsson is no stranger to the big screen - he starred as himself in the 2014 Ice Hockey film, Breakaway.</p>
<h1 id="Who-is-the-NHL-Player-that-Played-Vesper-in-Casino-Royale"><a href="#Who-is-the-NHL-Player-that-Played-Vesper-in-Casino-Royale" class="headerlink" title="Who is the NHL Player that Played Vesper in Casino Royale?"></a>Who is the NHL Player that Played Vesper in Casino Royale?</h1><p>In the 2006 James Bond film Casino Royale, one of the characters is Vesper Lynd, a British agent working undercover at the casino. The role was played by French actress Eva Green.</p>
<p>While Vesper Lynd’s identity is not explicitly revealed in the film, it is later confirmed that she is in fact the NHL player that played Vesper in Casino Royale. In a 2007 interview, Eva Green stated that her brother plays professional hockey in Canada and that she had asked him to teach her how to skate so that she could play the role of Vesper.</p>
<p>Since then, Eva Green has gone on to star in numerous other films, including Kingdom of Heaven (2005), 300: Rise of an Empire (2014), and Sin City: A Dame to Kill For (2014). She will also be appearing in the upcoming TV series Penny Dreadful.</p>
<h1 id="NHL-Player-Vesper-in-Casino-Royale-speculation"><a href="#NHL-Player-Vesper-in-Casino-Royale-speculation" class="headerlink" title="NHL Player Vesper in Casino Royale speculation"></a>NHL Player Vesper in Casino Royale speculation</h1><p>When news surfaced that Daniel Craig would be donning the tuxedo and playing Agent 007 in the 21st installment of the James Bond movie franchise, Casino Royale, there was much speculation over who would play the villain. Names like Clive Owen, Ewan McGregor, and Hugh Jackman were tossed about. In the end, Czechoslovakian actor Mads Mikkelsen was cast as Le Chiffre.</p>
<p>A lesser known name that was bandied about as a possible Bond villain was Vesper Lynd (played by Eva Green). Vesper is a complex character who starts out as an agent working for MI6 and then turns against Bond. Some believe that Vesper is actually a double agent working for Le Chiffre.</p>
<p>There is some buzz on the internet that NHL player Maximillian “Max” Vesper will play the role of Vesper in Casino Royale. Vesper is originally from Austria and played junior hockey for Team Austria before being drafted by the Nashville Predators in the 4th round of the 2009 NHL Entry Draft. He has since played for their minor league affiliate, the Milwaukee Admirals.</p>
<p>At 6’3” and 205 lbs., Vesper has the size to play the role of Bond villain. His skills on the ice could also come in handy during some of the action sequences in Casino Royale. He has dual citizenship (Austrian and American) and could easily play either a European or American villain in the movie.</p>
<p>The producers of Casino Royale have not yet confirmed whether or not Max Vesper will be playing the role of Vesper Lynd. However, with filming set to begin this winter, it won’t be long before we know for sure.</p>
<h1 id="Report-NHL-Player-to-Play-Vesper-in-Upcoming-James-Bond-Film-Casino-Royale"><a href="#Report-NHL-Player-to-Play-Vesper-in-Upcoming-James-Bond-Film-Casino-Royale" class="headerlink" title="Report: NHL Player to Play Vesper in Upcoming James Bond Film Casino Royale"></a>Report: NHL Player to Play Vesper in Upcoming James Bond Film Casino Royale</h1><p>A report in the Toronto Sun states that National Hockey League (NHL) player, Mike Fisher, will play Vesper in the upcoming James Bond Film Casino Royale.</p>
<p>The report quotes a source close to the production as saying, “Mike is perfect for the role. He’s got the looks and he’s a great actor.”</p>
<p>In addition to his acting skills, Fisher is no stranger to the world of 007. The Ottawa Senators center made a cameo appearance as a poker player in Die Another Day, the 20th installment of the Bond series.</p>
<p>Casino Royale, which is scheduled for release in November 2006, will be Daniel Craig’s Bond debut.</p>
<h1 id="Who-will-play-the-role-of-vesper-in-casino-royale-NHL"><a href="#Who-will-play-the-role-of-vesper-in-casino-royale-NHL" class="headerlink" title="Who will play the role of vesper in casino royale NHL"></a>Who will play the role of vesper in casino royale NHL</h1><p>It is well-known that Daniel Craig will be playing the role of James Bond in the latest installment of the Casino Royale movie series. However, there is much speculation about who will play the role of vesper. Some reports suggest that Eva Green will take on the role, but others say that no decision has yet been made.</p>
<p>Green would be a great choice for the part, as she has both acting and modeling experience. She is also no stranger to action movies, having starred in 300: Rise of an Empire. However, some people feel that another actress may be more suited to the role.</p>
<p>Whoever ends up playing vesper, we can be sure that they will have big shoes to fill. The character was originally played by Ursula Andress in the 1967 version of Casino Royale, and subsequent actresses including Diana Rigg and Famke Janssen have all brought their own unique take to the role.</p>

        <h1 id="Casino-Owner-Nets-1B-in-Annual-Income"><a href="#Casino-Owner-Nets-1B-in-Annual-Income" class="headerlink" title="Casino Owner Nets $1B in Annual Income!"></a>Casino Owner Nets $1B in Annual Income!</h1><p>Casino magnate Sheldon Adelson is the world’s 18th-richest person, with a net worth of $37.7 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. But the 82-year-old chairman and CEO of Las Vegas Sands Corp. has another distinction: his annual income from casino gambling is a staggering $1 billion.</p>
<p>How does he do it? Forbes takes a closer look at Adelson’s empire and reports that while gambling revenues have flattened in recent years as China cracks down on corruption, Adelson has been able to offset that by expanding his casino empire to countries such as Singapore and Japan:</p>
<p>“In Macau, where Adelson gets the bulk of his gambling revenue, profits are up despite a slowdown in visitation caused by Beijing’s anti-corruption campaign. That’s because gamblers there are betting more money: In the first quarter of 2016, they averaged around HK$13 million (US$1.7 million) per trip, compared with HK$9 million (US$1.2 million) three years ago.”</p>
<p>Adelson isn’t just betting on casinos either. He’s also heavily invested in technology startups:</p>
<p>“He has also put money into electric car company Tesla Motors Inc., data center company Switch Communications Inc. and medical marijuana firm Insys Therapeutics Inc.”</p>
<p>All told, it’s no wonder that Adelson brings in over $1 billion each year from casinos - he’s got a lot of irons in the fire!</p>
<h1 id="Casino-Tycoon-Earns-More-Than-1B-in-a-Year"><a href="#Casino-Tycoon-Earns-More-Than-1B-in-a-Year" class="headerlink" title="Casino Tycoon Earns More Than $1B in a Year!"></a>Casino Tycoon Earns More Than $1B in a Year!</h1><p>Casino tycoon Sheldon Adelson has made a fortune in the casino business. This week, it was reported that he earned more than $1 billion in a year from his casinos, making him the highest-earning American businessman.</p>
<p>Adelson owns the Venetian Resort Hotel Casino and Sands Casino Resort in Las Vegas, as well as casinos in Singapore and Macau. His earnings have been boosted by the rise in gambling revenue in Asia.</p>
<p>In addition to his casino businesses, Adelson also owns the newspaper Israel Hayom. He is one of Israel’s richest people, with a net worth of $37 billion.</p>
<p>Adelson is no stranger to controversy. In 2012, he made headlines when he said that Israel should “bomb Iran” to prevent it from acquiring nuclear weapons. He also drew criticism for reportedly making racist comments about Chinese people.</p>
<p>Despite his controversial statements, Adelson remains a powerful figure in both business and politics. In recent years, he has become a major donor to Republican candidates and causes.</p>
<h1 id="How-Much-Money-Does-a-Casino-Owner-Make"><a href="#How-Much-Money-Does-a-Casino-Owner-Make" class="headerlink" title="How Much Money Does a Casino Owner Make?"></a>How Much Money Does a Casino Owner Make?</h1><p>Casino ownership is a profitable business, but just how much money can be made by owning a casino? The answer to that question varies depending on the size and location of the casino, as well as the overhead costs associated with running it.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, casino owners make a percentage of each bet that is placed in their establishment. That percentage varies from casino to casino, but is typically in the range of 3-5%. So for every $100 that is wagered at a casino, the owner would make between $3 and $5.</p>
<p>Of course, there are other sources of income for casino owners, such as from food and beverage sales, hotel rooms, and other amenities. But the vast majority of income for casino owners comes from gambling profits.</p>
<p>It’s also worth noting that not all casinos are profitable. In fact, many lose money each year. This is particularly true of smaller casinos located in rural areas. Larger casinos located in major metropolitan areas are more likely to be profitable.</p>
<p>So how much money can a casino owner expect to make each year? It really depends on the individual casino and how well it is run. However, it’s not uncommon for casino owners to earn millions of dollars annually from their gambling profits alone.</p>
<h1 id="Casino-Mogul-Earns-More-Than-1B-Annually"><a href="#Casino-Mogul-Earns-More-Than-1B-Annually" class="headerlink" title="Casino Mogul Earns More Than $1B Annually!"></a>Casino Mogul Earns More Than $1B Annually!</h1><p>It’s no secret that casino mogul Sheldon Adelson is one of the richest people on the planet. But what may come as a shock is that he earns more than $1 billion annually from his casinos!</p>
<p>Forbes estimates that Adelson’s net worth is approximately $32.8 billion, making him the eighth-richest person in the world. And much of that wealth comes from his casinos.</p>
<p>Adelson owns the Venetian Macao, which is the largest casino in the world. It generated $4.2 billion in revenue in 2017, according to Forbes. That’s more than any other casino on the planet!</p>
<p>Adelson also has a stake in Sands China, which operates several casinos in Macau. That company generated $2.9 billion in revenue last year.</p>
<p>So how does Adelson make so much money from his casinos?</p>
<p>Well, for starters, he charges high fees for gaming licenses. In Macau, for example, license fees can range from $500 million to $1 billion depending on the size of the casino.</p>
<p>Adelson also takes a hefty chunk of the profits from his casinos. In Macau, casino operators typically keep around 35% of their revenues after paying taxes and gaming duties. But Adelson takes home closer to 50%.</p>
<p>And then there are all those rooms and restaurants that Adelson charges for! The Venetian Macao has 6,000 hotel rooms and costs $500 per night on average. The Sands China properties have another 5,000 rooms between them! And meals at one of Adelson’s restaurants will set you back at least $50 apiece.</p>
<p>So it’s easy to see why Sheldon Adelson is one of the richest men on Earth!</p>
<h1 id="How-Much-Does-a-Casino-Owner-Make-Per-Year"><a href="#How-Much-Does-a-Casino-Owner-Make-Per-Year" class="headerlink" title="How Much Does a Casino Owner Make Per Year?"></a>How Much Does a Casino Owner Make Per Year?</h1><p>Casino owners make a lot of money each year. The amount of money that they make varies depending on the size of the casino and how successful it is. However, on average, casino owners make about $1 million per year.</p>
<p>The amount of money that a casino owner makes varies depending on the size of the casino. Generally, the bigger the casino, the more money the owner will make. This is because there are more opportunities to make money at a large casino than at a small one. For example, a casino owner can make money from the games that are offered, from food and beverage sales, and from gambling taxes.</p>
<p>In addition, a casino owner can also make money by owning other casinos. In fact, some casino owners are so successful that they have multiple casinos. This allows them to spread their risk and increase their profits.</p>
<p>The amount of money that a casino owner makes also depends on how successful the casino is. A casino that is doing well will bring in more money for the owner than one that is not doing as well. In order to be successful, a casino must offer good customer service and have attractive games with high payouts.</p>
<p>Finally, the amount of money that a casino owner makes also depends on the location of the casino. Casinos located in popular tourist destinations tend to be more successful than those located in less desirable areas. As a result, owners of these casinos typically make more money.</p>
<p>Overall, it is clear that casino owners make a lot of money each year. The amount that they make varies depending on a number of factors, but on average they earn about $1 million per year.</p>

        <h1 id="Where-is-the-nearest-casino-to-be-able-to-me-Cuba"><a href="#Where-is-the-nearest-casino-to-be-able-to-me-Cuba" class="headerlink" title="Where is the nearest casino to be able to me Cuba?"></a>Where is the nearest casino to be able to me Cuba?</h1><p>There are a few casinos in Cuba, but the nearest ones to be able to you depend on where you are inside country. If you are near Havana, then the chances are good that there is a casino close by. However, if you are located in a more rural area, there may be a longer distance to travel.</p>
<p>Here are some of the most popular casinos in Cuba:</p>
<ol>
<li>Gran Casino Havana</li>
</ol>
<p>This casino is located in the heart of Havana and it is one of the largest casinos in Cuba. It offers blackjack, baccarat, roulette, and poker tables as well as slot machines. There is also a restaurant on site.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Hotel Riviera Maya Casino</li>
</ol>
<p>This casino is located in the town of Varadero and it offers table games such as blackjack and roulette, as well as slots and video poker machines. It also has a sports bar on site.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Hotel Nacional de Cuba Casino</li>
</ol>
<p>This casino is located in Havana and it offers table games such as blackjack, baccarat, roulette, and poker, as well as slots and video poker machines. There is also a nightclub on site where you can enjoy music and drinks after playing at the casino.</p>
<h1 id="How-far-away-is-the-nearest-casino-to-be-able-to-me-Cuba"><a href="#How-far-away-is-the-nearest-casino-to-be-able-to-me-Cuba" class="headerlink" title="How far away is the nearest casino to be able to me Cuba?"></a>How far away is the nearest casino to be able to me Cuba?</h1><p>Casinos are found in many places around the world, but there are none in Cuba. Officially, gambling is illegal on the island. This means that the nearest casino for people in Cuba is about 1,060 miles away in Nassau, Bahamas.</p>
<p>The prohibition on gambling in Cuba goes back to 1933 when the Cuban government passed a law banning most forms of gambling. Poker and blackjack were allowed to continue under this law, but other games were not. In 1959, Fidel Castro’s Marxist-Leninist revolution led to an even stricter stance against gambling, with violators facing imprisonment.</p>
<p>While there have been some efforts to overturn the prohibition on gambling in Cuba, they have all failed. One reason for this may be that the Cuban government sees gambling as a way to fleece people of their money and line the pockets of criminals. Gambling also has negative consequences for society as a whole, leading to increased crime and social problems.</p>
<p>There are no casinos in Cuba, and the nearest one is about 1,060 miles away in Nassau, Bahamas</p>
<h1 id="What-kind-of-casinos-are-near-me-Cuba"><a href="#What-kind-of-casinos-are-near-me-Cuba" class="headerlink" title="What kind of casinos are near me Cuba?"></a>What kind of casinos are near me Cuba?</h1><p>Casinos in Cuba come in a few different varieties. There are the big resort casinos, which are typically located near tourist areas. Many of these casinos are owned and operated by foreign companies. There are also a number of small, independent casinos around the country.</p>
<p>Some of the most popular resorts for casino gambling are in Havana, Varadero, and Santiago de Cuba. If you’re looking for a high-end gambling experience, then one of the big resort casinos is probably what you’re looking for. These casinos offer all sorts of table games and slot machines.</p>
<p>Smaller casinos can be found in all kinds of locations, from beach towns to mountain villages. They typically offer a limited selection of games, but they can be a lot of fun if you’re looking for something more relaxed and intimate.</p>
<p>If you’re planning to gamble in Cuba, it’s important to be aware of the rules and regulations that apply to casino gaming there. For instance, note that locals are not allowed to gamble in the resort casinos.</p>
<h1 id="What-amenities-does-the-nearest-casino-to-be-able-to-me-Cuba-have"><a href="#What-amenities-does-the-nearest-casino-to-be-able-to-me-Cuba-have" class="headerlink" title="What amenities does the nearest casino to be able to me Cuba have?"></a>What amenities does the nearest casino to be able to me Cuba have?</h1><p>There are a few casinos near me in Cuba, but I’m not sure what amenities they have. I think one of them has a restaurant, but I’m not sure.</p>
<h1 id="Are-there-any-special-rules-or-regulations-about-casinos-in-me-vicinity-of-Cuba"><a href="#Are-there-any-special-rules-or-regulations-about-casinos-in-me-vicinity-of-Cuba" class="headerlink" title="Are there any special rules or regulations about casinos in me vicinity of Cuba?"></a>Are there any special rules or regulations about casinos in me vicinity of Cuba?</h1><p>Casinos in Cuba are heavily regulated by the Cuban government. There are a few different types of casinos in Cuba, and the regulations vary depending on the type of casino.</p>
<p>The most common type of casino in Cuba is the state-owned casino. These casinos are owned and operated by the Cuban government. The games that are offered at state-owned casinos are tightly regulated, and no outside betting is allowed.</p>
<p>The second type of Cuban casino is the private casino. These casinos are owned and operated by private businesses. Private casinos offer a wider variety of games than state-owned casinos, and outside betting is allowed. However, private casinos are subject to much more regulation than state-owned casinos. For example, private casinos are not allowed to operate within 500 meters of a school or a place of worship.</p>
<p>There are also a few illegal casinos in Cuba. These casinos operate without any licensing or regulation from the Cuban government. They offer games like blackjack, roulette, and slot machines, which are all illegal in Cuba. Illegally operating casinos can be shut down by the Cuban government at any time.</p>

<p>The Stanley Cup is also considered one of the most difficult trophies to win; out of 124 years of competition, only 31 teams (25%) have won the championship.</p>
<p>The NHL regular season begins in October and ends in April. The playoffs, which determine the Stanley Cup champion, begin in April and last into June.</p>
<h1 id="What-are-the-odds-for-Lithuania-to-win-the-World-Cup-Hockey"><a href="#What-are-the-odds-for-Lithuania-to-win-the-World-Cup-Hockey" class="headerlink" title="What are the odds for Lithuania to win the World Cup Hockey?"></a>What are the odds for Lithuania to win the World Cup Hockey?</h1><p>This year’s World Cup of Hockey is set to be one of the most exciting tournaments in recent memory. With powerhouse nations like Canada, the United States and Sweden all competing, it will be a challenge for any team to make it to the final. However, one country that could potentially make a run at the title is Lithuania.</p>
<p>Ranked 22nd in the world by IIHF, Lithuania is not expected to make much noise in the tournament. However, with some strong performances by their top players, they could upset some of the higher-ranked teams.</p>
<p>Leading Lithuania into battle will be captain Zygimantas Chvedukas. The 26-year-old forward is coming off his best season yet in the KHL, scoring 16 goals and adding 18 assists in 58 games with Dinamo Riga. Chvedukas has also been impressive for Lithuania in international competition, scoring 20 points (9 goals, 11 assists) in 17 games played.</p>
<p>Joining Chvedukas up front will be another KHL standout – Mantas Armalis. The 25-year-old netminder had a solid season with Slovan Bratislava, posting a 2.28 GAA and .923 save percentage in 38 games played. Armalis has also been impressive for Lithuania in international play, recording a 2.01 GAA and .930 save percentage in six appearances.</p>
<p>On defense, Lithuania will look to captain Darnell Nurse to lead the way. The 21-year-old Edmonton Oilers prospect had a breakout season in the NHL last year, registering 14 assists and playing in all 82 games for the Oilers. Nurse has also been impressive for Canada internationally, registering six points (1 goal, 5 assists) in 15 games played.</p>
<p>Other notable players on Lithuania’s roster include: forward Nerijus Alisauskas (KHL), forwards Valdemars Vasiljevs and Giedrius Musteikis (both from Vilnius HC), defenseman Arturas Koputchinsky (CSKA Moscow) and goaltender Henri Sorvali (Sarpsborg 08).</p>
<p>While they may not be considered one of the favourites to win the tournament, don’t count out Lithuania – they have what it takes to upset some of hockey’s elite nations.</p>
