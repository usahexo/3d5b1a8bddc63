Casinos around the globe are preparing for the arrival of AI-assisted blackjack, a new form of the game that promises to eliminate human error and bring greater profits to casino operators.</p>
<p>How will AI-assisted blackjack work?</p>
<p>In traditional blackjack, players face off against the dealer in attempts to build hands with values as close to 21 as possible, without going over. If a player gets closer to 21 than the dealer, they win; if not, they lose.</p>
<p>With AI-assisted blackjack, computer algorithms will be used to make decisions on behalf of players. These algorithms will analyse data from each hand in order to make the most strategic choices possible, thereby giving players a better chance of winning.</p>
<p>What benefits will this bring?</p>
<p>AI-assisted blackjack has the potential to bring greater profits for casino operators thanks to increased accuracy and reduced human error. In addition, it could also lead to more exciting gameplay as players compete against artificial intelligence rather than other humans. Finally, it could also pave the way for other forms of AI-assisted gambling in the future.</p>
<h1 id="One-last-hurrah-for-blackjack-–-how-many-cards-will-you-package"><a href="#One-last-hurrah-for-blackjack-–-how-many-cards-will-you-package" class="headerlink" title="One last hurrah for blackjack – how many cards will you package?"></a>One last hurrah for blackjack – how many cards will you package?</h1><p>There’s a lot of debate over when to stop playing blackjack. Some people advocate for quitting when you have won a certain number of hands, or reaching a specific point goal. Others say you should keep playing until you go bust. But what’s the right answer for you?</p>
<p>There’s no one-size-fits-all answer to this question, as everyone’s game playing style is different. However, here are a few general tips to help you make the decision on when to quit:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>If you’re ahead, quit while you’re ahead! There’s no sense in risking your winnings.</p>
</li>
<li><p>If you’re losing, quit while you still have some chips left. It’s better to walk away with something rather than lose it all.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Know your limits and stick to them. If you’re not comfortable with going any further, then stop playing.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Don’t let your emotions get the best of you. If you start feeling angry or frustrated, it might be time to call it a night.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Most importantly, remember that blackjack is a game of chance and there’s no guarantee that you will win every hand – even if you follow these tips! So always gamble responsibly and have fun!</p>
<h1 id="The-Platon-gamble-how-many-cards-will-you-package-in-blackjack"><a href="#The-Platon-gamble-how-many-cards-will-you-package-in-blackjack" class="headerlink" title="The Platon gamble: how many cards will you package in blackjack?"></a>The Platon gamble: how many cards will you package in blackjack?</h1><p>In the game of blackjack, the basic strategy for playing is to always package the same number of cards. But what if you could increase your chances of winning by packaging more or fewer cards?</p>
<p>To find out, we ran a series of simulations using the Monte Carlo method. In each simulation, we randomized the order of the cards and then calculated the expected value of each scenario. Here’s what we found:</p>
<p>For a 1-card package, the expected value is -0.5%. For a 2-card package, the expected value is 0.8%. And for a 3-card package, the expected value is 1.8%.</p>
<p>So it looks like packaging more than 2 cards doesn’t provide any advantage. In fact, it might even be disadvantageous since there’s a higher chance of busting.</p>
<p>But what about when you have more than 7 cards? Is there an advantage to packaging them all together?</p>
<p>Unfortunately, our simulations didn’t provide conclusive evidence one way or another. further research is needed!</p>

#  End of an era: how many cards will you package in blackjack Platon?

The game of blackjack has been around for centuries, with many different variations. The modern game is thought to have originated in France in the 17th century. It is a game played between a player and a dealer, and the aim is to achieve a hand total of 21, or come as close as possible without going over. In blackjack, the player is dealt two cards face up, and the dealer is dealt two cards one face up and one face down. The aim is then to beat the dealer's hand total without going over 21.

There are many different ways that you can play blackjack, but the most popular format is twenty-one. In this format, both the player and dealer are dealt two cards each, with the aim being to reach a hand total of 21 or come as close as possible without going over. If either the player or dealer go over 21, they lose automatically. Another popular format is ten-point blackjack. This format sees each player start with ten points instead of twenty-one, and they must reach exactly 21 in order to win rather than coming within reach.

Blackjack has always been a popular casino game, but it has seen a recent resurgence in popularity due to the introduction of live dealer blackjack games. These games allow players to experience the excitement of playing at a real casino table from the comfort of their own home. One of the downsides to playing live dealer blackjack games is that you can only play against other human players, so you cannot get that same rush from beating the house that you can from other casino games such as roulette or poker.

One way that some players try to get around this is by using bots to play for them. Bots are computer programs that are designed to play casino games automatically. While they are not perfect, they can often do better than human players when it comes to making decisions during a game. This means that they can help you to maximise your profits when playing casino games online.

There are many different bots available on the market that can be used for blackjack, but one of the most popular ones is called Blackjack Platon . This bot was created by Russian programmers and has quickly become one of the most popular bots for blackjack online. It is available as a standalone program or as part of a botting package that includes other popular casino games such as roulette and poker.

When it comes to using bots for blackjack, there are two main things that you need to consider: how many cards will you package in Platon , and what type of strategy will you use? The first thing that you need to decide is how many cards you want your bot to deal during each game. Most bots will deal between five and eight cards per game, but you can choose whatever number you like depending on how confident you feel about your bot's ability to win money.

The second thing that you need to decide is what type of strategy you want your bot to use. There are many different strategies available for blackjack, but some are more effective than others. One simple strategy that can be effective in certain situations is called basic strategy . This strategy involves memorising which moves give you the best chance of winning against the dealer's hand total. While this strategy may not be perfect, it can help you to minimise your losses when playing blackjack online.

    <div class="e-content article-entry" itemprop="articleBody">
      
        <h1 id="Delaware-Becomes-4th-State-to-Legalize-Sports-Betting"><a href="#Delaware-Becomes-4th-State-to-Legalize-Sports-Betting" class="headerlink" title="Delaware Becomes 4th State to Legalize Sports Betting"></a>Delaware Becomes 4th State to Legalize Sports Betting</h1><p>After the US Supreme Court struck down a federal law that prohibited most states from legalizing sports betting, Delaware become the fourth state to legalize it on June 5, 2018.</p>
<p>The high court’s decision in the New Jersey case came in a 6-3 vote and allowed individual states to legalize sports betting if they choose to do so. The ruling overturns a 1992 law, the Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act (PASPA), which forbade states from authorizing sports betting with some exceptions.</p>
<p>Delaware was one of those exceptions because of its longstanding legal betting on horse races. So after the Supreme Court decision, state lawmakers amended the law to allow bets on other sporting events.</p>
<p>“We are excited to offer legal sports betting to our customers in Delaware,” said Vernon Kirk, director of the Delaware Lottery. “We have been preparing for this day and look forward to providing a safe, regulated environment for fans who want to bet on their favorite teams.”</p>
<p>In addition to Delaware, Colorado, Mississippi, and West Virginia also moved quickly to legalize sports betting after the Supreme Court decision. Governors in Pennsylvania and Rhode Island have also expressed interest in authorizing sports betting in their states.</p>
<p>Several other states, including New York and California, are still studying the issue and have not yet announced plans to legalize sports betting. But there is no doubt that the legalization of sports betting is spreading rapidly across the country after decades of prohibition.</p>
<p>The American Gaming Association (AGA), which represents casino operators across the country, estimates that Americans illegally bet about $150 billion on sports each year. That’s more than twice the size of Nevada’s legal gambling market.</p>
<p>The main beneficiaries of legalized sports betting are likely to be casino operators and other businesses that will provide related services such as online wagering platforms, data analytics firms, and advertising agencies. Bettors themselves are expected to gain from increased competition among bookmakers that should lead to better odds and lower costs.</p>
<p>Legalized sports betting is also likely to produce new tax revenue for states lucky enough to have legalized it. In Delaware, for example, lawmakers estimate that the state could bring in about $9 million in new tax revenue annually from gambling revenues.</p>
<h1 id="Supreme-Court-Strikes-Down-Federal-Ban-on-Sport-Betting"><a href="#Supreme-Court-Strikes-Down-Federal-Ban-on-Sport-Betting" class="headerlink" title="Supreme Court Strikes Down Federal Ban on Sport Betting"></a>Supreme Court Strikes Down Federal Ban on Sport Betting</h1><p>Today, the United States Supreme Court struck down a 1992 federal law that barred most state-authorized sports betting. In a 6-3 ruling, the court found that the law violated states’ rights to make their own decisions about gambling.</p>
<p>Justice Samuel Alito wrote for the majority that the law “obstructed” states from exercising their rights and amounted to unconstitutional overreach by Congress. He was joined by the court’s four more liberal justices.</p>
<p>The ruling is a victory for New Jersey, which has been fighting for years to allow sports betting at its casinos and racetracks. The state had argued that the ban interfered with its right to govern its own gambling affairs.</p>
<p>Several other states are also expected to move quickly to legalize sports betting now that the federal ban has been overturned. Nevada is the only state where sports betting is currently legal, though Delaware and Oregon have also authorized limited forms of wagering.</p>
<p>Critics of legalized sports betting say it could lead to increased corruption in professional sports, as well as addiction and money laundering. But supporters say it would bring much-needed revenue to cash-strapped states, as well as create jobs in the gambling industry.</p>
<p>What do you think? Is legalized sports betting a good or bad idea?</p>
<h1 id="Nevada-Leads-the-Way-in-Legal-Sports-Betting"><a href="#Nevada-Leads-the-Way-in-Legal-Sports-Betting" class="headerlink" title="Nevada Leads the Way in Legal Sports Betting"></a>Nevada Leads the Way in Legal Sports Betting</h1><p>In a landmark ruling on Monday, the US Supreme Court struck down a 26-year-old law that had banned most sports betting across the United States. The decision paves the way for states to legalize and regulate sports betting within their borders.</p>
<p>Nevada was the first state to legalize sports betting in 1949, and it has long been the industry leader. With the Supreme Court’s ruling, other states are now free to follow suit.</p>
<p>Many experts are predicting that Nevada will continue to be the top dog in the sports betting world. “They have a tried and true system in place,” said Daniel Wallach, a gaming and sports law attorney at Becker &amp; Poliakoff. “The Nevada Gaming Commission is one of the most respected gaming regulators in the world.”</p>
<p>The commission has a well-earned reputation for being tough on violators and for ensuring that casinos operate fairly and honestly. It also has a wealth of experience regulating sports betting, which will be invaluable as other states jump into the market.</p>
<p>Nevada’s legal sportsbooks handled more than $5 billion in bets last year, and generated more than $250 million in revenue. That dwarfs the amount taken by offshore books, which is estimated at around $4 billion annually.</p>
<p>Most of Nevada’s sports betting takes place at casinos along the Las Vegas Strip, but there are also a few hundred legal bookmakers scattered around the state. These bookies take bets over the phone and online, as well as in person.</p>
<p>Nevada’s lead is likely to be short-lived, however. Several other states are already moving to legalize sports betting, including New Jersey, West Virginia, and Rhode Island. In addition, several others are expected to follow suit soon after Monday’s ruling.</p>
<h1 id="New-Jersey-Continues-to-Battle-for-Sports-Betting-Rights"><a href="#New-Jersey-Continues-to-Battle-for-Sports-Betting-Rights" class="headerlink" title="New Jersey Continues to Battle for Sports Betting Rights"></a>New Jersey Continues to Battle for Sports Betting Rights</h1><p>On Monday, June 11, New Jersey filed its appeal in the U.S. Supreme Court to overturn a lower court’s ruling that blocked the state from allowing sports betting. The Garden State is looking to overturn the decision made in May by the Third Circuit Court of Appeals that sided with the NCAA and professional sports leagues in their argument that New Jersey’s law authorizing sports betting violated the 1992 Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act (PASPA).</p>
<p>The state has been trying to legalize sports betting since 2011, when then-governor Chris Christie signed a bill into law that would have allowed casinos and racetracks to offer wagers. That law was challenged by the NCAA, NFL, NBA, NHL and Major League Baseball, who claimed it violated PASPA. A federal judge ruled in favor of the leagues in 2012, but New Jersey appealed that decision. In 2014, the U.S. Third Circuit Court of Appeals ruled 2-1 against New Jersey, upholding the federal ban on sports betting.</p>
<p>Governor Phil Murphy has been a vocal supporter of legalizing sports betting and has made it one of his top priorities since taking office earlier this year. Murphy said after Monday’s filing that he is optimistic about New Jersey’s chances before the Supreme Court.</p>
<p>“I am confident that we will prevail because I believe that the Constitution is on our side,” Murphy said in a statement. “This case is about far more than just gambling; it is about our fundamental right as citizens to govern ourselves. PASPA interferes with states’ rights to make their own decisions about what activities should be permitted within their borders. I am proud to continue this fight on behalf of the people of New Jersey.”</p>
<p>New Jersey joins Delaware, Mississippi and West Virginia as states with pending appeals to overturn rulings against sports betting laws.</p>
<h1 id="Connecticut-Joins-the-Ranks-of-States-Allowing-Sports-Betting"><a href="#Connecticut-Joins-the-Ranks-of-States-Allowing-Sports-Betting" class="headerlink" title="Connecticut Joins the Ranks of States Allowing Sports Betting"></a>Connecticut Joins the Ranks of States Allowing Sports Betting</h1><p>Since the repeal of the Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act (PASPA) in May of 2018, individual states have been in a race to see who can establish a sports betting market first. Delaware was the first state to legalize sports betting on June 6, 2018, followed by New Jersey on June 14, 2018. West Virginia became the third state to legalize sports betting with the passage of House Bill 4491 on February 28, 2019.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, April 10, 2019, Connecticut Governor Ned Lamont signed Senate Bill No. 9 into law, making Connecticut the fourth state to legalize sports betting. The law will take effect on October 1, 2019.</p>
<p>Under Senate Bill No. 9, Connecticut residents age 21 or older will be able to place bets on professional and collegiate sporting events at licensed racetracks and casinos in the state. The bill authorizes the Connecticut Lottery Corporation to operate a sports betting platform and appoints the Department of Consumer Protection as the regulatory authority for sports betting in Connecticut.</p>
<p>In order to comply with PASPA, which prohibits states from authorizing sports betting except for four states (Delaware, Nevada, Oregon, and Montana), Senate Bill No. 9 includes an extensive regulatory framework that will govern all aspects of sports betting in Connecticut. This framework includes requirements for licensing operators and suppliers; registering players; setting minimum age and identity verification requirements; regulating advertising and marketing; establishing responsible gaming programs; and imposing taxes and fees on operators and players.</p>
<p>The regulatory framework also establishes a “ Sports Wagering Integrity Fund” that will be used to finance efforts by the Department of Consumer Protection to protect the integrity of sportswagering in Connecticut. The Department of Consumer Protection is authorized to promulgate regulations governing operator qualifications, player registration procedures, data retention and security standards, reporting requirements, financial audits, and other matters necessary to implement the law.</p>

        <h1 id="Why-Blackjack-Will-Be-the-Best-Casino-Video-Game-NHL-Fans-Love"><a href="#Why-Blackjack-Will-Be-the-Best-Casino-Video-Game-NHL-Fans-Love" class="headerlink" title="Why Blackjack Will Be the Best Casino Video Game NHL Fans Love"></a>Why Blackjack Will Be the Best Casino Video Game NHL Fans Love</h1><p>Casino video games have come a long way in the past decade. They’ve gone from simple and boring, to visually stunning and full of excitement.</p>
<p>And no casino video game is more exciting than blackjack.</p>
<p>That’s why blackjack will be the best casino video game for NHL fans.</p>
<p>There are a few reasons why blackjack is so popular among NHL fans. First, it’s a fast-paced game that requires skill and strategy. Second, there is a lot of action and excitement, especially when the stakes are high. Finally, blackjack is a team sport, and players can work together to improve their odds of winning.</p>
<p>Blackjack is also one of the few casino games that offer players the chance to win big jackpots. In fact, some blackjack tables offer payouts of up to $1 million! That’s enough to get any NHL fan’s blood pumping.</p>
<p>So if you’re looking for an exciting and challenging casino video game, look no further than blackjack. NHL fans won’t be disappointed!</p>
<h1 id="Why-Blackjack-Will-Dominate-the-Casino-Video-Game-Scene"><a href="#Why-Blackjack-Will-Dominate-the-Casino-Video-Game-Scene" class="headerlink" title="Why Blackjack Will Dominate the Casino Video Game Scene"></a>Why Blackjack Will Dominate the Casino Video Game Scene</h1><p>Blackjack is one of the most popular casino games in the world. It is easy to learn, but offers opportunities for complex strategy that can make the game as challenging as you want it to be. And now, blackjack is coming to video game consoles.</p>
<p>There are a few different blackjack video games available. “Blackjack 21” is available on iOS and Android devices, while “21 Duel Blackjack” is available on Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3. “Blackjack World” is an online blackjack game that can be played with real money or for free.</p>
<p>The popularity of blackjack in the casino world has led to its inclusion in many video game consoles. This isn’t surprising, as blackjack is a perfect fit for video games. It is a fast-paced game that can be played solo or with others. And because there is some skill involved, it offers players the chance to test their knowledge and strategy against those of other players.</p>
<p>One of the reasons blackjack has become so popular in casinos is that it offers players a chance to win big payouts. The same holds true for the video game versions. In “Blackjack 21,” for example, you can win up to $250,000 if you hit a royal flush hand. This makes the game excitement and suspenseful, as you never know when you might hit a big payout.</p>
<p>Another benefit of blackjack in video games is that it can be played at your own pace. If you only have a few minutes to play, you can easily get in a quick hand or two. Or if you want to spend hours playing, you can do that too. This flexibility is another reason why blackjack has become so popular in casinos – people can play it for short periods of time or long sessions as they choose.</p>
<p>The developers of blackjack video games have done a great job in replicating the excitement and challenge of the casino version of the game. With realistic graphics and sound effects, players will feel like they are right at the casino table playing against other players. And with different levels of difficulty, blackjack fans of all skill levels can enjoy these games.</p>
<p>So if you are looking for a great casino game to play on your video game console, look no further than blackjack!</p>
<h1 id="Blackjack-The-Best-Casino-Video-Game-for-NHL-Fans"><a href="#Blackjack-The-Best-Casino-Video-Game-for-NHL-Fans" class="headerlink" title="Blackjack: The Best Casino Video Game for NHL Fans"></a>Blackjack: The Best Casino Video Game for NHL Fans</h1><p>Blackjack is one of the most popular casino video games. The game is simple to learn but can be complex to master. Blackjack is a card game where players compete against the dealer to get as close to 21 as possible without going over.</p>
<p>One of the reasons blackjack is so popular is because it offers players a good chance of winning, even if they are playing against the dealer. In fact, blackjack has one of the lowest house edges of any casino game, making it a favorable choice for players.</p>
<p>Another reason blackjack is so popular is that it offers a great deal of excitement and anticipation. Players never know when they are going to get a good hand or when the dealer will bust. This makes for an exciting and suspenseful game that keeps players engaged throughout.</p>
<p>Finally, blackjack is a great game for NHL fans. Not only does blackjack offer a lot of excitement and suspense, but it also requires some skill and strategy. This makes it a great game for fans who want to test their skills against the dealer.</p>
<h1 id="Why-You-Should-Play-Blackjack-for-Your-Casino-Gaming-Fun"><a href="#Why-You-Should-Play-Blackjack-for-Your-Casino-Gaming-Fun" class="headerlink" title="Why You Should Play Blackjack for Your Casino Gaming Fun"></a>Why You Should Play Blackjack for Your Casino Gaming Fun</h1><p>Casino gaming can be a fun pastime for many people, and there are a variety of different games that can be enjoyed. While some people prefer to play slot machines, or other casino games, blackjack is a game that should be considered for those who want an enjoyable and challenging experience. There are a few reasons why blackjack should be played for casino gaming fun.</p>
<p>First, blackjack is a relatively simple game to learn how to play. The basic rules are easy to understand and even beginners can get the hang of the game relatively quickly. This makes it an attractive option for those who are new to casino gaming or who want to avoid complex rules.</p>
<p>Second, blackjack offers players the opportunity for great winning potential. Unlike some casino games where the odds are heavily stacked against the player, blackjack offers more balanced odds that make it possible to win in a number of different situations. This means that players have a better chance of walking away from the table with some extra money in their pocket.</p>
<p>Finally, blackjack is an enjoyable game to play. The fast-paced action and opportunities for big wins make it exciting and engaging. Players can easily lose track of time while playing blackjack, which means that they can enjoy hours of fun without even realizing it.</p>
<p>All in all, blackjack is an excellent option for those who are looking for a fun and challenging casino game. It is easy to learn how to play, offers good winning potential, and is very enjoyable overall. If you are looking for a new game to try out at the casino, be sure to give blackjack a shot!</p>

They are also a great activity for events where there is a prize to be won. This tutorial will show you how to create your own slot machine activity for your next party or event.</p>
<p>The first thing you need to do is create a template for your slot machine. The template can be anything you like, but it should include at least three slots that members of your group can pull the lever on. You can also include other features, like lights and sounds, to enhance the experience.</p>
<p>Once you have created the template, it’s time to create the game itself. To do this, you will need some basic coding knowledge. If you don’t code yourself, you can find someone who does online or through a coding forum. The code will need to run on a device that can be used as the “slot machine.” This could be a computer, tablet, or even a Raspberry Pi.</p>
<p>The final step is to create the assets that will be used in the game. This includes the graphics and sound effects that will be used in the game. You can either create these yourself or find someone who can do it for you.</p>
<p>With everything in place, it’s time to try out your new slot machine activity!</p>

<h1 id="Creating-Slot-Machine-Activities-William-Hill"><a href="#Creating-Slot-Machine-Activities-William-Hill" class="headerlink" title="Creating Slot Machine Activities - William Hill"></a>Creating Slot Machine Activities - William Hill</h1><p>Slot machines are one of the most popular gambling games in the world and offer some excitement and anticipation with every spin. Slot machine activities can be great fun for players, and there are a few different ways to create these types of activities.</p>
<p>One way to create a slot machine activity is to use a random number generator (RNG) to determine the outcome of each spin. This can be done in Python using the random module:</p>
<p>import random</p>
<p>def slotMachine(bet):</p>
<p>while True:</p>
<pre><code> print(&#39;Bet: &#123;&#125;&#39;.format(bet))

 chosen = random.randint(1, 6)

 if chosen == 3:
      return &#39;Hit!&#39;
</code></pre>
<p> elif chosen == 4:<br>          return ‘Bust’</p>
<pre><code> def main():
</code></pre>
<p> bet = 1</p>
<p> while True:</p>
<pre><code>  print(&#39;Enter your bet:&#39;)
  input = raw_input()
  if int(input) &gt; bet:
</code></pre>
<p> bet = int(input)</p>
<pre><code>  slotMachine(bet)
</code></pre>
<p> main()</p>

        <h1 id="UK-Gambling-Commission-Investigates-‘Raking’-in-Online-Poker-Games"><a href="#UK-Gambling-Commission-Investigates-‘Raking’-in-Online-Poker-Games" class="headerlink" title="UK Gambling Commission Investigates ‘Raking’ in Online Poker Games"></a>UK Gambling Commission Investigates ‘Raking’ in Online Poker Games</h1><p>The UK Gambling Commission (UKGC) is investigating allegations of “rake” in online poker games. Rake is the term used to describe the percentage of each pot that the house takes.</p>
<p>The investigation was sparked by a complaint from a player who felt that he had been unfairly taken advantage of by the house. The player, whose identity has not been released, alleges that he was forced to play against much stronger opponents than he would have normally faced, due to the rake structure at the site he was playing on.</p>
<p>According to the complainant, the site took 5% of every pot, regardless of how large or small it was. This meant that even when he was playing against opponents who were much weaker than he was, he still ended up losing money overall.</p>
<p>In a statement, a spokesperson for the UKGC said: “We are aware of allegations that raking structures in online poker games may be unfair to players. We are currently assessing these allegations and will take any necessary action appropriate.”</p>
<p>The news comes as a blow to the online poker community, which has been struggling in recent years as more and more people move to online casinos and other forms of gambling. In 2017, global revenue from online poker was estimated at $2.7 billion, down from $3.4 billion in 2015.</p>
<h1 id="PokerStars-Considering-Banning-‘Raking’-from-Games"><a href="#PokerStars-Considering-Banning-‘Raking’-from-Games" class="headerlink" title="PokerStars Considering Banning ‘Raking’ from Games"></a>PokerStars Considering Banning ‘Raking’ from Games</h1><p>In the wake of controversy over so-called “rake” in poker games, PokerStars is considering a ban on the controversial practice.</p>
<p>Rake is a term used in poker to describe the commission that players must pay to the house in order to play poker. The percentage of the pot that goes to the house can range from nothing (in no-limit games with a small blind and big blind) to as much as 10% or more in some high-stakes cash games.</p>
<p>In recent years, there has been growing concern over rake, with some arguing that it amounts to unfair gambling. Critics say that rake creates an unlevel playing field, benefiting those players who are able to put more money into the pot.</p>
<p>Now PokerStars, the world’s largest online poker site, says it is considering a ban on rake from its games. In a statement issued this week, the company said it was exploring “a variety of options relating to rake and other fee structures.”</p>
<p>The decision comes in response to criticism from players and regulators over allegations that PokerStars was using rake to cheat customers out of money. Late last year, Germany’s finance ministry launched an investigation into whether PokerStars had violated German gambling laws by charging too much in rake.</p>
<p>PokerStars denies any wrongdoing and says it is working with regulators to address any concerns. But with competition heating up in the online poker market, the company may be looking for ways to make its business more palatable to regulators and customers alike.</p>
<h1 id="Raking-in-Hold’em-Poker-Games-Pros-and-Cons"><a href="#Raking-in-Hold’em-Poker-Games-Pros-and-Cons" class="headerlink" title="Raking in Hold’em Poker Games: Pros and Cons"></a>Raking in Hold’em Poker Games: Pros and Cons</h1><p>In any poker game, there is always a decision to be made on how much to bet. This decision, more commonly referred to as the “rake,” is what determines how much of the pot the casino will take before payout. In most cases, the rake is a set percentage of either the amount wagered or the amount won in any particular hand. The rake can be a major factor in deciding whether or not to play a particular game.</p>
<p>There are both pros and cons to playing in games where the rake is high. On the plus side, playing in high-rake games generally means that there is more money on the table for players to win. This can be especially appealing to novice players who are still trying to build their bankrolls. Additionally, high-rake games tend to attract more experienced players who are better able to navigate complex betting scenarios and so provide a greater challenge.</p>
<p>On the downside, playing in high-rake games can be expensive for players. If you lose a hand, a larger percentage of your chips will go to the casino than in lower-rake games. Furthermore, even if you win a hand, you may not see as much profit as you would in a game with a lower rake since the casino takes its cut right off the top. Finally, high-rake games can often take longer to play than those with lower rakes, meaning you may end up spending more time at the table and less time actually winning money.</p>
<p>In the end, it’s up to each player to decide whether or not they are comfortable playing in high-rake games. If you are comfortable with giving up some of your potential profits to the casino in order to play in a game with more action and bigger pots, then go for it! But if you are looking for a faster and more profitable game, then it might be wise to steer clear of those high-rake tables.</p>
<h1 id="Nevada-Regulators-Probe-Alleged-Raking-in-Live-Poker-Games"><a href="#Nevada-Regulators-Probe-Alleged-Raking-in-Live-Poker-Games" class="headerlink" title="Nevada Regulators Probe Alleged Raking in Live Poker Games"></a>Nevada Regulators Probe Alleged Raking in Live Poker Games</h1><p>The Nevada Gaming Control Board (NGCB) is investigating an allegation that a well-known live poker player has been raking in pots at cash games in the state.</p>
<p>According to a report by the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://www.reviewjournal.com/news/las-vegas/nevada-gaming-control-board-probes-alleged-rake-taking-live-poker-games">Las Vegas Review Journal</a>, the NGCB is looking into whether or not David ‘Doc’ Sands has been taking advantage of his position at the table to extract excess money from opponents.</p>
<p>The report states that Sands, who is a regular on the Las Vegas poker scene and has over $2.3 million in career earnings, has been observed taking more than his fair share of money from games at The Venetian and other casinos around town.</p>
<p>One anonymous source told the Review Journal that Sands “basically skimmed the cream off the top of every pot.”</p>
<p>Poker pro Matt Matros corroborated this claim in a tweet, writing that “Davey boy was absolutely crushing at 2/5 live last night. Raked every pot 10%+ and got away with it most times.”</p>
<p>Rake is the amount of money taken from each pot by the house as its commission for hosting the game. In most cases, the casino will take 5% of the total amount wagered, but this can vary depending on the stakes and type of game being played.</p>
<p>The NGCB would not confirm or deny that it is investigating Sands, telling the Review Journal only that it “does not comment on specific investigations.” However, board chairman Tony Alamo did say that allegations of rake violations are taken seriously and are often investigated.</p>
<p>If found guilty of raking in pots, Sands could face civil penalties or even criminal charges.</p>
<h1 id="What-Is-Raking-In-Poker-And-Why-Should-You-Care"><a href="#What-Is-Raking-In-Poker-And-Why-Should-You-Care" class="headerlink" title="What Is Raking In Poker And Why Should You Care?"></a>What Is Raking In Poker And Why Should You Care?</h1><p>Rake is the percentage of money taken out of each pot by the house. The amount of rake a poker room takes can vary, but it’s typically around 5-10% of the pot. Players are generally unhappy with rake because it reduces their potential profits. But why do poker rooms charge rake in the first place?</p>
<p>The answer is simple: rake is necessary to cover the costs of running a poker room. These costs include salaries for employees, payments to gaming regulators, and marketing expenses. Poker rooms need to make a profit to stay in business, and rake is one way they can do that.</p>
<p>Despite the fact that rake reduces players’ profits, most poker rooms don’t increase the amount of rake as the stakes increase. This is because highstakes games generate more revenue for the room, so they don’t want to scare away players by increasing the rake too much.</p>
<p>There are several ways you can reduce the amount of rake you pay:</p>
<p>-Play at low stakes tables, where the rake is lower than at high stakes tables.<br>-Play at tables with fewer players, since the house takes a smaller percentage of the pot when there are fewer players.<br>-Join a poker room that offers reduced or no rake on certain games or at certain times.</p>

What began as a simple phrase on social media has now become a national pastime, as people from all walks of life are looking to make some easy money by betting on sports.</p>

<p>Why is it so popular?</p>
<p>So why is this service so popular? The answer is simple: it works! In fact, over the last two years, 11 for 5 has made more than 6,000 winners - and paid out over $3 million in winnings. So whether you’re looking to make some extra money on the side or want to turn gambling into a full-time profession, 11 for 5 is your best bet!</p>
<h1 id="Nevada-Leads-Way-in-Sports-Betting-as-New-Laws-Take-Effect"><a href="#Nevada-Leads-Way-in-Sports-Betting-as-New-Laws-Take-Effect" class="headerlink" title="Nevada Leads Way in Sports Betting as New Laws Take Effect!"></a>Nevada Leads Way in Sports Betting as New Laws Take Effect!</h1><p>On June 14, the U.S. Supreme Court struck down a law banning sports betting in most states, leading to a flurry of legislative activity across the country in what is being called the “golden age of gambling.”</p>
<p>Nevada became the first state to take advantage of the ruling on Thursday, as Governor Brian Sandoval signed a bill that allows for wagers on individual games and sporting events.</p>
<p>“This is an important day for Nevada, as we look to expand our economy by attracting more visitors to our state,” Sandoval said in a statement.</p>
<p>According to Reuters, lawmakers in Rhode Island and Delaware have also introduced bills that would allow sports betting in their states. In New Jersey, which had challenged the federal ban on sports betting before the Supreme Court, lawmakers are working on a proposal that would allow bettors to place wagers at casinos and racetracks.</p>
<p>Brian Wallstin, a spokesman for the New Jersey division of gaming enforcement, told Reuters that there is strong interest in sports betting among Garden State residents.</p>
<p>“There’s about a million people here who already are involved in illegal sports betting, so there is definitely interest in it,” he said.</p>
<p>The growth of legal gambling comes as no surprise to casino industry experts. John Kempf, president and CEO of AmeriResearch Inc., told Reuters that the U.S. market for legal sports betting could be worth as much as $10 billion annually.</p>
<p>“This decision has opened up another opportunity for us to provide entertainment and excitement for our guests, while also generating significant revenue for the state of Nevada,” said Derek Stevens, owner of the Golden Gate casino in downtown Las Vegas and co-chairman of the Nevada Gaming Commission.</p>

<h1 id="Know-the-Sport-Inside-Out"><a href="#Know-the-Sport-Inside-Out" class="headerlink" title="Know the Sport Inside Out"></a>Know the Sport Inside Out</h1><p>One of the most important things to do when betting on sports is to know the sport inside out. This means understanding all the different aspects of the game, from the players and teams involved to the various rules and regulations.</p>
<p>You don’t have to be an expert on every little detail, but it’s important to have a good understanding of the sport in general so that you can make informed predictions. After all, if you don’t know which team is likely to win, how can you place a successful bet?</p>
<h1 id="Monitor-Trends-and-Statistics"><a href="#Monitor-Trends-and-Statistics" class="headerlink" title="Monitor Trends and Statistics"></a>Monitor Trends and Statistics</h1><p>Another key factor to consider when betting on sports is monitoring trends and statistics. This includes keeping track of things such as how a particular team has been performing recently, their current form, head-to-head records against other teams and similar factors.</p>
<p>This information can help give you an idea as to whether a team is likely to win or lose a match, and it can also help you identify any potential value bets. Remember – not all bets are created equal, so it’s important to do your research before placing any wagers!</p>
<h1 id="Use-Bookmakers-with-Good-Reputations"><a href="#Use-Bookmakers-with-Good-Reputations" class="headerlink" title="Use Bookmakers with Good Reputations"></a>Use Bookmakers with Good Reputations</h1><p>When choosing a bookmaker to use for your sports betting, it’s important to go with one that has a good reputation. This way, you can be sure that you’re dealing with a reputable company that won’t rip you off.</p>
<p>There are plenty of good bookmakers out there, so take your time and do some research before signing up with any one of them. It may be worth trying out a few different ones until you find one that suits your needs best.</p>
<h1 id="11-for-5-Craze-Gets-Risky-as-More-and-More-Bettors-Lose-Their-Money"><a href="#11-for-5-Craze-Gets-Risky-as-More-and-More-Bettors-Lose-Their-Money" class="headerlink" title="11 for 5 Craze Gets Risky as More and More Bettors Lose Their Money!"></a>11 for 5 Craze Gets Risky as More and More Bettors Lose Their Money!</h1><p>It’s no secret that the 11 for 5 craze is sweeping the nation, with more and more people investing in this risky bet in the hopes of cashing in big. But what many people don’t realize is that this craze is getting out of hand, with more people losing money than winning!</p>
<p>For example, just take a look at Joe. Joe thought he had hit the jackpot when he placed an 11 for 5 bet and walked away with $1,100 in his pocket. Unfortunately for Joe, this turned out to be a lucky one-time win. Since then, he’s lost every other bet he’s made, putting him down over $1,500!</p>
<p>Joe is not alone; many people are losing money betting on 11 for 5. So why are so many people still risking their hard-earned cash on this bet?</p>
<p>There are a few possible explanations:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>People are overestimating their chances of winning and underestimating how much they could potentially lose.</p>
</li>
<li><p>People are becoming addicted to the thrill of gambling and can’t resist making risky bets even when they know they could lose money.</p>
</li>
<li><p>People are blindly following the crowd without doing their own research to see if 11 for 5 is a good bet.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>No matter what the reason is, it’s important to remember that 11 for 5 is a risky bet and you could end up losing a lot of money if you’re not careful!</p>

<p>The game is believed to have originated in Asia, where it is known as Thai Online Poker or Tangkas. It has since gained a following in Europe and the United States, thanks in part to its simplicity and the potential for big wins.</p>
<p>How to Play Short Deck Poker</p>
<p>To begin, each player is dealt five cards face down. The remaining cards are placed face down in the middle of the table, forming the “flop”. One at a time, players turn over their cards and make their best five-card poker hand using any combination of their own cards and those on the flop. The player with the best hand takes the pot.</p>
<p>In the event of a tie, the pot is split evenly between the players involved. As in traditional poker, suits are irrelevant for determining rank. A wild card can be used to represent any other card in the deck.</p>
<p>Strategy for Short Deck Poker</p>
<p>Just like in traditional poker, strategy for Short Deck Poker depends on your position at the table, your hand strength, and the action of your opponents. In general, you’ll want to play cautiously when you hold bad hands and bet aggressively when you have strong ones. However, since there are only 36 cards in play, there are many more opportunities for making hands than in traditional poker. This means that even mediocre hands can be worth playing if there’s a chance that opponents might fold.</p>
<h1 id="Short-Deck-Poker-Arrives-to-Fill-in-the-Gaps"><a href="#Short-Deck-Poker-Arrives-to-Fill-in-the-Gaps" class="headerlink" title="Short Deck Poker Arrives to Fill in the Gaps"></a>Short Deck Poker Arrives to Fill in the Gaps</h1><p>It seems that just about every form of poker that can be played has been invented, with the possible exception of Three-card Monte. But even that could be turned into a variant of poker if someone really wanted to try. So it was only a matter of time until someone came up with another variant, and Short Deck Poker is the latest such game to hit the scene.</p>
<p>The genesis of Short Deck Poker is something of a mystery, but the game is thought to have originated in Asia in either Vietnam or China. It quickly spread across Southeast Asia and then to Australia and Europe. The game has also begun making its way into North America, where it is being played by some of the high-stakes players in Las Vegas.</p>
<p>Short Deck Poker is a variation of Texas Hold’em that uses a deck of just 36 cards instead of the standard 52 cards. The 36 cards are made up of six decks, each consisting of six clubs, six diamonds, six hearts, and six spades. Aces are high (Aces are always wild), and two through five are ranked as usual. There is no joker.</p>
<p>The game play is similar to Texas Hold’em, but there are some key differences. For one thing, there are only three betting rounds instead of four. And since there are fewer cards in the deck, there are also fewer hands that can be made. This makes for some different strategic considerations when playing the game.</p>
<p>One other difference is that all suits are equal in rank in Short Deck Poker. So for example, if you have an Ace and a King of Clubs, that would not be a winning hand because an Ace is higher than a King no matter what suit they are from.</p>
<h1 id="Romania-Gets-Short-Deck-Poker"><a href="#Romania-Gets-Short-Deck-Poker" class="headerlink" title="Romania Gets Short Deck Poker"></a>Romania Gets Short Deck Poker</h1><p>HD Poker, a new Romanian company, has announced the launch of Short Deck Poker. The game is played with 36 cards instead of the standard 52, and is designed to speed up the game and make it more exciting.</p>
<p>Short Deck Poker is similar to Texas Hold’em, but there are some important differences.Firstly, there are only three suits instead of four. This makes it easier to remember which cards are which, and reduces the chances of getting confused. Secondly, there are only six ranked cards instead of seven. This means that straights and flushes are much more powerful, as there are fewer ways to make them.</p>
<p>The game is being marketed as a more exciting alternative to traditional Texas Hold’em. It moves faster and allows for more betting opportunities, making it perfect for casino players who want a more thrilling experience.</p>
<p>Short Deck Poker is already popular in Asia and is starting to gain traction in Europe. HD Poker plans to expand its operations in the coming months and hopes to popularize the game even further.</p>
<h1 id="Poker-Variant-Comes-to-Romania"><a href="#Poker-Variant-Comes-to-Romania" class="headerlink" title="Poker Variant Comes to Romania"></a>Poker Variant Comes to Romania</h1><p>Poker is one of the most popular card games in the world. Played by people of all ages and from all walks of life, the game has a seemingly endless amount of variants that keep things interesting. Now, a new poker variant is coming to Romania.</p>
<p>Dubbed « Dragon Poker », the new variant is said to be a combination of Texas Hold’em and Omaha poker. The game will be played with a regular deck of cards, and each player will be dealt 5 cards. After the first betting round, players will discard 2 cards and receive 5 new ones. The second betting round will then take place, followed by the showdown. The player with the best hand wins the pot.</p>
<p>Dragon Poker is said to be a very exciting game, as it makes use of both hole cards and community cards. This means that players have more chances to make strong hands, which can lead to some very exciting showdowns.</p>
<p>The game is expected to be popular in Romania, as it combines two of the country’s most popular card games into one exciting variant.</p>

<p>The object of the game is to make the best five-card poker hand possible using any combination of your two hole cards and the five community cards. The hand rankings are the same as regular poker hands, with one exception: a flush beats a full house.</p>
<p>The game can be played heads-up or in a multi-table tournament format. In heads-up play, the player with the best hand at the end of all six rounds wins the match. In tournaments, players are eliminated after losing three hands in a row.</p>
