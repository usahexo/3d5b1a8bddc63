#  Lions Cruise Departs Saturday!

The Lions will depart for their game in Brisbane on Saturday morning with plenty of optimism reigning supreme.

A convincing 36-14 win over the Warriors last Friday has set up the trip perfectly, with the players now feeling like they can take on anyone.

Lions coach Chris Fagan said his side was capable of beating the competition frontrunners, and they'll be looking to do just that this weekend.

"We're not going up there thinking we're going to lose," he said.

"We think we can win, and that's what we'll be trying to do."

The Lions have been boosted by the return of star midfielder Dayne Beams for the clash, after he missed last week's match with a calf injury.

However, they'll still be without captain Harris Andrews (ankle) and ruckman Stefan Martin (injured).

The Lions have won just one game against Brisbane in their history, way back in round nine, 2009.

#  All Aboard the Lions Cruise!

The Detroit Lions are set to cruise their way into the playoffs this year and they’re looking for fans to come along for the ride! The Lions have been on a tear lately, winning four out of their last five games. This past Sunday, they managed to come back from a 14-point deficit to beat the Carolina Panthers 27-24.

Matthew Stafford has been playing out of his mind lately, throwing for over 2,000 yards and 16 touchdowns in just nine games. Wide receiver Golden Tate is having a career year with 959 yards and seven touchdowns. Rookie running back Kerryon Johnson has also played a big role in the team’s success, running for 558 yards and three touchdowns.

The Lions are now set to take on the Chicago Bears this Sunday at home. If they can manage to win that game, they will clinch a playoff berth. If you’re a fan of the Detroit Lions, or if you just want to see them in the playoffs, be sure to buy tickets to their cruise!

#  Detroit Lions Set to Embark on Casino Cruise

The Detroit Lions are set to embark on their first casino cruise of the season. The team is coming off a disappointing year in which they finished with a record of 7-9. With a new head coach in place, the team is looking to turn things around this season.

One of the ways that the Lions are hoping to improve their fortunes is by taking advantage of the casino cruise opportunities that are available to them. The team is confident that the casino cruises will help them get closer to the playoffs.

In order to take full advantage of the casino cruises, the Lions have made some changes to their roster. They have added several players who have experience in the casino world. One of those players is cornerback Darius Slay, who has experience working as a blackjack dealer on riverboats in Mississippi.

Slay joins a number of other Lions players who have experience in the casino world. That includes defensive end Ezekiel Ansah, who was raised in Ghana and learned how to play cards from his grandfather. Ansah has said that he plans to use his knowledge of cards to help him win games on the field this season.

Other Lions players with casino experience include quarterback Matthew Stafford and wide receiver Golden Tate. Stafford says that he plans to use his knowledge of blackjack and other games to help him win big bucks on the cruise ship casinos. Tate says that he plans to use his skills as a professional gambler to make some serious money while on board.

The Lions are scheduled to depart for their first casino cruise next week. The cruise will last for four days, and it will include stops at several different casinos along the way. The team is hoping that their time on board will be fruitful, and that they will be able to come back home with some extra money in their pockets.

I'm sitting in the airport, typing on my phone. I'm leaving tomorrow morning for a week-long lion cruise through Botswana and Zambia. I'm so excited!

I've always wanted to go on safari, and this cruise is the perfect way to do it. We'll be sailing down the Chobe River in Botswana and then up the Zambezi River in Zambia. We'll see lions, elephants, hippos, crocodiles, and more!

The cruise is organized by Wild Earth Safaris, a company that specializes in wildlife tours. I know that I'm going to have an amazing time. I can't wait to see some of the most beautiful animals on Earth up close.
