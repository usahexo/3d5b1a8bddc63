#  How far away is the nearest casino to be able to me Cuba?

Casinos are found in many places around the world, but there are none in Cuba. Officially, gambling is illegal on the island. This means that the nearest casino for people in Cuba is about 1,060 miles away in Nassau, Bahamas.

The prohibition on gambling in Cuba goes back to 1933 when the Cuban government passed a law banning most forms of gambling. Poker and blackjack were allowed to continue under this law, but other games were not. In 1959, Fidel Castroâ€™s Marxist-Leninist revolution led to an even stricter stance against gambling, with violators facing imprisonment.

While there have been some efforts to overturn the prohibition on gambling in Cuba, they have all failed. One reason for this may be that the Cuban government sees gambling as a way to fleece people of their money and line the pockets of criminals. Gambling also has negative consequences for society as a whole, leading to increased crime and social problems.
