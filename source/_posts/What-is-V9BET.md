#  Where is Lithuania?

Located in northeastern Europe, Lithuania is a republic that borders Latvia to the north, Belarus to the east, Poland to the south, and Kaliningrad Oblast, a Russian territory, to the southwest. The country has a total area of 65,300 square kilometers (25,212 sq mi) and a population of about 3 million. Vilnius is the capital and largest city.

# History

The first inhabitants of present-day Lithuania arrived more than 10,000 years ago. The region was later settled by Baltic tribes who formed the Grand Duchy of Lithuania in 1253 and united with Poland in 1569 to form the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. After World War I, Lithuania declared independence but was seized by the Soviet Union in 1940. It regained its independence in 1990 following the collapse of the Soviet Union.

Since becoming an independent country, Lithuania has been grappling with questions of national identity and integration into Western institutions. In 2004, it became a member of NATO and the European Union. In 2015, it adopted the euro as its currency.

Lithuania has a rich cultural heritage, with traditions that date back many centuries. The country is also known for its folk art, music, and costumes.

#  What is NHL?

The National Hockey League (NHL) is a professional ice hockey league in North America, consisting of 30 teams: 23 in the United States and 7 in Canada. The NHL is considered the best ice hockey league in the world.

The Stanley Cup is the oldest professional sports trophy in North America and was first awarded to the Montreal Amateur Athletic Association in 1893. The Stanley Cup is engraved with the names of every player, coach, and executive associated with the winning team for that year.

The Stanley Cup is also considered one of the most difficult trophies to win; out of 124 years of competition, only 31 teams (25%) have won the championship.

The NHL regular season begins in October and ends in April. The playoffs, which determine the Stanley Cup champion, begin in April and last into June.

#  What are the odds for Lithuania to win the World Cup Hockey?

This year’s World Cup of Hockey is set to be one of the most exciting tournaments in recent memory. With powerhouse nations like Canada, the United States and Sweden all competing, it will be a challenge for any team to make it to the final. However, one country that could potentially make a run at the title is Lithuania.

Ranked 22nd in the world by IIHF, Lithuania is not expected to make much noise in the tournament. However, with some strong performances by their top players, they could upset some of the higher-ranked teams.

Leading Lithuania into battle will be captain Zygimantas Chvedukas. The 26-year-old forward is coming off his best season yet in the KHL, scoring 16 goals and adding 18 assists in 58 games with Dinamo Riga. Chvedukas has also been impressive for Lithuania in international competition, scoring 20 points (9 goals, 11 assists) in 17 games played.

Joining Chvedukas up front will be another KHL standout – Mantas Armalis. The 25-year-old netminder had a solid season with Slovan Bratislava, posting a 2.28 GAA and .923 save percentage in 38 games played. Armalis has also been impressive for Lithuania in international play, recording a 2.01 GAA and .930 save percentage in six appearances.

On defense, Lithuania will look to captain Darnell Nurse to lead the way. The 21-year-old Edmonton Oilers prospect had a breakout season in the NHL last year, registering 14 assists and playing in all 82 games for the Oilers. Nurse has also been impressive for Canada internationally, registering six points (1 goal, 5 assists) in 15 games played.

Other notable players on Lithuania’s roster include: forward Nerijus Alisauskas (KHL), forwards Valdemars Vasiljevs and Giedrius Musteikis (both from Vilnius HC), defenseman Arturas Koputchinsky (CSKA Moscow) and goaltender Henri Sorvali (Sarpsborg 08).

While they may not be considered one of the favourites to win the tournament, don’t count out Lithuania – they have what it takes to upset some of hockey’s elite nations.
