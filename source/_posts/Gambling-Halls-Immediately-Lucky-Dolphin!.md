#  Lucky Dolphin Strikes Again!

The Dolphin is one of the luckiest creatures in the animal kingdom. Time and time again, they seem to defy the odds and emerge unscathed from dangerous encounters.

In late 2017, a pod of dolphins was spotted swimming near a pod of humpback whales. While it’s not unheard of for dolphins and whales to share the same waters, it is usually the whales who are feared by the smaller dolphins. This time, however, it was the dolphins who managed to outsmart the humpbacks.

The humpbacks were reportedly trying to herd the dolphins towards shallow water where they could potentially be captured, but the dolphins scattered and managed to avoid them. One dolphin in particular seemed to be particularly lucky – or savvy – as it swam directly beneath a whale’s body, avoiding its enormous tail.

This isn’t the first time that dolphins have outsmarted their predators. In 2015, a pod of bottlenose dolphins was spotted swimming near some sharks. The sharks were apparently attacking and eating a porpoise when the dolphins suddenly surrounded them and drove them away from their prey.

It seems that the dolphin has few natural predators thanks to their intelligence and quick reflexes. They are one of only a handful of animals that can actually outwit their predators – making them one of nature’s biggest winners!

#  Dolphin Giving Luck To New Gambling Halls!

Dolphin sightings have been considered as lucky omens by gamblers across the globe. In the southern United States, they are commonly referred to as 'bottlenose dolphins'. This little marine mammal has a long history of being associated with games of chance and good luck.

There are many instances where dolphins have been caught swimming near or in front of new gambling establishments shortly before they opened for business. Gambling hall managers and casino owners have taken to displaying pictures or statues of dolphins in their establishments as a way to bring good luck to their guests and employees.

In fact, one casino in Atlantic City has a live bottlenose dolphin on display in their tanks! Guests can watch the dolphin frolic and play while they enjoy some gaming action. It is said that this particular casino has had much success since adding the dolphin exhibit and that their guests always seem to be winning!

Interestingly, the ancient Greeks believed that dolphins were the protectors of lost treasures at sea. Sailors would often seek out dolphins for guidance, in the hopes that they could help lead them to lost riches. This may be where the tradition of seeing dolphins as symbols of good luck began.

So next time you're at a casino, keep your eyes peeled for these playful creatures - you might just be lucky enough to catch a glimpse of one!
