#  UK Gambling Commission Investigates 'Raking' in Online Poker Games

The UK Gambling Commission (UKGC) is investigating allegations of "rake" in online poker games. Rake is the term used to describe the percentage of each pot that the house takes.

The investigation was sparked by a complaint from a player who felt that he had been unfairly taken advantage of by the house. The player, whose identity has not been released, alleges that he was forced to play against much stronger opponents than he would have normally faced, due to the rake structure at the site he was playing on.

According to the complainant, the site took 5% of every pot, regardless of how large or small it was. This meant that even when he was playing against opponents who were much weaker than he was, he still ended up losing money overall.

In a statement, a spokesperson for the UKGC said: "We are aware of allegations that raking structures in online poker games may be unfair to players. We are currently assessing these allegations and will take any necessary action appropriate."

The news comes as a blow to the online poker community, which has been struggling in recent years as more and more people move to online casinos and other forms of gambling. In 2017, global revenue from online poker was estimated at $2.7 billion, down from $3.4 billion in 2015.

#  PokerStars Considering Banning 'Raking' from Games

In the wake of controversy over so-called "rake" in poker games, PokerStars is considering a ban on the controversial practice.

Rake is a term used in poker to describe the commission that players must pay to the house in order to play poker. The percentage of the pot that goes to the house can range from nothing (in no-limit games with a small blind and big blind) to as much as 10% or more in some high-stakes cash games.

In recent years, there has been growing concern over rake, with some arguing that it amounts to unfair gambling. Critics say that rake creates an unlevel playing field, benefiting those players who are able to put more money into the pot.

Now PokerStars, the world's largest online poker site, says it is considering a ban on rake from its games. In a statement issued this week, the company said it was exploring "a variety of options relating to rake and other fee structures."

The decision comes in response to criticism from players and regulators over allegations that PokerStars was using rake to cheat customers out of money. Late last year, Germany's finance ministry launched an investigation into whether PokerStars had violated German gambling laws by charging too much in rake.

PokerStars denies any wrongdoing and says it is working with regulators to address any concerns. But with competition heating up in the online poker market, the company may be looking for ways to make its business more palatable to regulators and customers alike.

#  Raking in Hold'em Poker Games: Pros and Cons

In any poker game, there is always a decision to be made on how much to bet. This decision, more commonly referred to as the “rake,” is what determines how much of the pot the casino will take before payout. In most cases, the rake is a set percentage of either the amount wagered or the amount won in any particular hand. The rake can be a major factor in deciding whether or not to play a particular game.

There are both pros and cons to playing in games where the rake is high. On the plus side, playing in high-rake games generally means that there is more money on the table for players to win. This can be especially appealing to novice players who are still trying to build their bankrolls. Additionally, high-rake games tend to attract more experienced players who are better able to navigate complex betting scenarios and so provide a greater challenge.

On the downside, playing in high-rake games can be expensive for players. If you lose a hand, a larger percentage of your chips will go to the casino than in lower-rake games. Furthermore, even if you win a hand, you may not see as much profit as you would in a game with a lower rake since the casino takes its cut right off the top. Finally, high-rake games can often take longer to play than those with lower rakes, meaning you may end up spending more time at the table and less time actually winning money.

In the end, it’s up to each player to decide whether or not they are comfortable playing in high-rake games. If you are comfortable with giving up some of your potential profits to the casino in order to play in a game with more action and bigger pots, then go for it! But if you are looking for a faster and more profitable game, then it might be wise to steer clear of those high-rake tables.

#  Nevada Regulators Probe Alleged Raking in Live Poker Games

The Nevada Gaming Control Board (NGCB) is investigating an allegation that a well-known live poker player has been raking in pots at cash games in the state.

According to a report by the <a href="http://www.reviewjournal.com/news/las-vegas/nevada-gaming-control-board-probes-alleged-rake-taking-live-poker-games">Las Vegas Review Journal</a>, the NGCB is looking into whether or not David ‘Doc’ Sands has been taking advantage of his position at the table to extract excess money from opponents.

The report states that Sands, who is a regular on the Las Vegas poker scene and has over $2.3 million in career earnings, has been observed taking more than his fair share of money from games at The Venetian and other casinos around town.

One anonymous source told the Review Journal that Sands “basically skimmed the cream off the top of every pot.”

Poker pro Matt Matros corroborated this claim in a tweet, writing that “Davey boy was absolutely crushing at 2/5 live last night. Raked every pot 10%+ and got away with it most times.”

Rake is the amount of money taken from each pot by the house as its commission for hosting the game. In most cases, the casino will take 5% of the total amount wagered, but this can vary depending on the stakes and type of game being played.

The NGCB would not confirm or deny that it is investigating Sands, telling the Review Journal only that it “does not comment on specific investigations.” However, board chairman Tony Alamo did say that allegations of rake violations are taken seriously and are often investigated.

If found guilty of raking in pots, Sands could face civil penalties or even criminal charges.

#  What Is Raking In Poker And Why Should You Care?

Rake is the percentage of money taken out of each pot by the house. The amount of rake a poker room takes can vary, but it’s typically around 5-10% of the pot. Players are generally unhappy with rake because it reduces their potential profits. But why do poker rooms charge rake in the first place?

The answer is simple: rake is necessary to cover the costs of running a poker room. These costs include salaries for employees, payments to gaming regulators, and marketing expenses. Poker rooms need to make a profit to stay in business, and rake is one way they can do that.

Despite the fact that rake reduces players’ profits, most poker rooms don’t increase the amount of rake as the stakes increase. This is because highstakes games generate more revenue for the room, so they don’t want to scare away players by increasing the rake too much.

There are several ways you can reduce the amount of rake you pay:

-Play at low stakes tables, where the rake is lower than at high stakes tables.
-Play at tables with fewer players, since the house takes a smaller percentage of the pot when there are fewer players.
-Join a poker room that offers reduced or no rake on certain games or at certain times.
