#  New Report Claims NHL Player Played Vesper in Casino Royale

A new report has surfaced that claims NHL player, Erik Karlsson, played a role in the 2006 James Bond Film, Casino Royale.

The Ottawa Citizen broke the story this morning, alleging that while Karlsson was in London attending a movie premiere with his then-girlfriend (now wife), he was asked by the producers of Casino Royale to take on a small acting role.

Karlsson is said to have landed the part of Vesper Lynd’s bodyguard, and can be seen briefly during the climactic casino scene.

When reached for comment, Karlsson’s agent had no comment on the report.

Karlsson is no stranger to the big screen - he starred as himself in the 2014 Ice Hockey film, Breakaway.

#  Who is the NHL Player that Played Vesper in Casino Royale?

In the 2006 James Bond film Casino Royale, one of the characters is Vesper Lynd, a British agent working undercover at the casino. The role was played by French actress Eva Green.

While Vesper Lynd's identity is not explicitly revealed in the film, it is later confirmed that she is in fact the NHL player that played Vesper in Casino Royale. In a 2007 interview, Eva Green stated that her brother plays professional hockey in Canada and that she had asked him to teach her how to skate so that she could play the role of Vesper.

Since then, Eva Green has gone on to star in numerous other films, including Kingdom of Heaven (2005), 300: Rise of an Empire (2014), and Sin City: A Dame to Kill For (2014). She will also be appearing in the upcoming TV series Penny Dreadful.

#  NHL Player Vesper in Casino Royale speculation

When news surfaced that Daniel Craig would be donning the tuxedo and playing Agent 007 in the 21st installment of the James Bond movie franchise, Casino Royale, there was much speculation over who would play the villain. Names like Clive Owen, Ewan McGregor, and Hugh Jackman were tossed about. In the end, Czechoslovakian actor Mads Mikkelsen was cast as Le Chiffre.

A lesser known name that was bandied about as a possible Bond villain was Vesper Lynd (played by Eva Green). Vesper is a complex character who starts out as an agent working for MI6 and then turns against Bond. Some believe that Vesper is actually a double agent working for Le Chiffre.

There is some buzz on the internet that NHL player Maximillian "Max" Vesper will play the role of Vesper in Casino Royale. Vesper is originally from Austria and played junior hockey for Team Austria before being drafted by the Nashville Predators in the 4th round of the 2009 NHL Entry Draft. He has since played for their minor league affiliate, the Milwaukee Admirals.

At 6'3" and 205 lbs., Vesper has the size to play the role of Bond villain. His skills on the ice could also come in handy during some of the action sequences in Casino Royale. He has dual citizenship (Austrian and American) and could easily play either a European or American villain in the movie.

The producers of Casino Royale have not yet confirmed whether or not Max Vesper will be playing the role of Vesper Lynd. However, with filming set to begin this winter, it won't be long before we know for sure.

#  Report: NHL Player to Play Vesper in Upcoming James Bond Film Casino Royale

A report in the Toronto Sun states that National Hockey League (NHL) player, Mike Fisher, will play Vesper in the upcoming James Bond Film Casino Royale.

The report quotes a source close to the production as saying, "Mike is perfect for the role. He's got the looks and he's a great actor."

In addition to his acting skills, Fisher is no stranger to the world of 007. The Ottawa Senators center made a cameo appearance as a poker player in Die Another Day, the 20th installment of the Bond series.

Casino Royale, which is scheduled for release in November 2006, will be Daniel Craig's Bond debut.

#  Who will play the role of vesper in casino royale NHL

It is well-known that Daniel Craig will be playing the role of James Bond in the latest installment of the Casino Royale movie series. However, there is much speculation about who will play the role of vesper. Some reports suggest that Eva Green will take on the role, but others say that no decision has yet been made.

Green would be a great choice for the part, as she has both acting and modeling experience. She is also no stranger to action movies, having starred in 300: Rise of an Empire. However, some people feel that another actress may be more suited to the role.

Whoever ends up playing vesper, we can be sure that they will have big shoes to fill. The character was originally played by Ursula Andress in the 1967 version of Casino Royale, and subsequent actresses including Diana Rigg and Famke Janssen have all brought their own unique take to the role.
