#  Delaware Becomes 4th State to Legalize Sports Betting

After the US Supreme Court struck down a federal law that prohibited most states from legalizing sports betting, Delaware become the fourth state to legalize it on June 5, 2018.

The high court's decision in the New Jersey case came in a 6-3 vote and allowed individual states to legalize sports betting if they choose to do so. The ruling overturns a 1992 law, the Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act (PASPA), which forbade states from authorizing sports betting with some exceptions.

Delaware was one of those exceptions because of its longstanding legal betting on horse races. So after the Supreme Court decision, state lawmakers amended the law to allow bets on other sporting events.

"We are excited to offer legal sports betting to our customers in Delaware," said Vernon Kirk, director of the Delaware Lottery. "We have been preparing for this day and look forward to providing a safe, regulated environment for fans who want to bet on their favorite teams."

In addition to Delaware, Colorado, Mississippi, and West Virginia also moved quickly to legalize sports betting after the Supreme Court decision. Governors in Pennsylvania and Rhode Island have also expressed interest in authorizing sports betting in their states.

Several other states, including New York and California, are still studying the issue and have not yet announced plans to legalize sports betting. But there is no doubt that the legalization of sports betting is spreading rapidly across the country after decades of prohibition.

The American Gaming Association (AGA), which represents casino operators across the country, estimates that Americans illegally bet about $150 billion on sports each year. That's more than twice the size of Nevada's legal gambling market.

The main beneficiaries of legalized sports betting are likely to be casino operators and other businesses that will provide related services such as online wagering platforms, data analytics firms, and advertising agencies. Bettors themselves are expected to gain from increased competition among bookmakers that should lead to better odds and lower costs.

Legalized sports betting is also likely to produce new tax revenue for states lucky enough to have legalized it. In Delaware, for example, lawmakers estimate that the state could bring in about $9 million in new tax revenue annually from gambling revenues.

#  Supreme Court Strikes Down Federal Ban on Sport Betting

Today, the United States Supreme Court struck down a 1992 federal law that barred most state-authorized sports betting. In a 6-3 ruling, the court found that the law violated states’ rights to make their own decisions about gambling.

Justice Samuel Alito wrote for the majority that the law “obstructed” states from exercising their rights and amounted to unconstitutional overreach by Congress. He was joined by the court’s four more liberal justices.

The ruling is a victory for New Jersey, which has been fighting for years to allow sports betting at its casinos and racetracks. The state had argued that the ban interfered with its right to govern its own gambling affairs.

Several other states are also expected to move quickly to legalize sports betting now that the federal ban has been overturned. Nevada is the only state where sports betting is currently legal, though Delaware and Oregon have also authorized limited forms of wagering.

Critics of legalized sports betting say it could lead to increased corruption in professional sports, as well as addiction and money laundering. But supporters say it would bring much-needed revenue to cash-strapped states, as well as create jobs in the gambling industry.

What do you think? Is legalized sports betting a good or bad idea?

#  Nevada Leads the Way in Legal Sports Betting

In a landmark ruling on Monday, the US Supreme Court struck down a 26-year-old law that had banned most sports betting across the United States. The decision paves the way for states to legalize and regulate sports betting within their borders.

Nevada was the first state to legalize sports betting in 1949, and it has long been the industry leader. With the Supreme Court's ruling, other states are now free to follow suit.

Many experts are predicting that Nevada will continue to be the top dog in the sports betting world. "They have a tried and true system in place," said Daniel Wallach, a gaming and sports law attorney at Becker & Poliakoff. "The Nevada Gaming Commission is one of the most respected gaming regulators in the world."

The commission has a well-earned reputation for being tough on violators and for ensuring that casinos operate fairly and honestly. It also has a wealth of experience regulating sports betting, which will be invaluable as other states jump into the market.

Nevada's legal sportsbooks handled more than $5 billion in bets last year, and generated more than $250 million in revenue. That dwarfs the amount taken by offshore books, which is estimated at around $4 billion annually.

Most of Nevada's sports betting takes place at casinos along the Las Vegas Strip, but there are also a few hundred legal bookmakers scattered around the state. These bookies take bets over the phone and online, as well as in person.

Nevada's lead is likely to be short-lived, however. Several other states are already moving to legalize sports betting, including New Jersey, West Virginia, and Rhode Island. In addition, several others are expected to follow suit soon after Monday's ruling.

#  New Jersey Continues to Battle for Sports Betting Rights

On Monday, June 11, New Jersey filed its appeal in the U.S. Supreme Court to overturn a lower court’s ruling that blocked the state from allowing sports betting. The Garden State is looking to overturn the decision made in May by the Third Circuit Court of Appeals that sided with the NCAA and professional sports leagues in their argument that New Jersey’s law authorizing sports betting violated the 1992 Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act (PASPA).

The state has been trying to legalize sports betting since 2011, when then-governor Chris Christie signed a bill into law that would have allowed casinos and racetracks to offer wagers. That law was challenged by the NCAA, NFL, NBA, NHL and Major League Baseball, who claimed it violated PASPA. A federal judge ruled in favor of the leagues in 2012, but New Jersey appealed that decision. In 2014, the U.S. Third Circuit Court of Appeals ruled 2-1 against New Jersey, upholding the federal ban on sports betting.

Governor Phil Murphy has been a vocal supporter of legalizing sports betting and has made it one of his top priorities since taking office earlier this year. Murphy said after Monday’s filing that he is optimistic about New Jersey’s chances before the Supreme Court.

“I am confident that we will prevail because I believe that the Constitution is on our side,” Murphy said in a statement. “This case is about far more than just gambling; it is about our fundamental right as citizens to govern ourselves. PASPA interferes with states’ rights to make their own decisions about what activities should be permitted within their borders. I am proud to continue this fight on behalf of the people of New Jersey.”

New Jersey joins Delaware, Mississippi and West Virginia as states with pending appeals to overturn rulings against sports betting laws.

#  Connecticut Joins the Ranks of States Allowing Sports Betting

Since the repeal of the Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act (PASPA) in May of 2018, individual states have been in a race to see who can establish a sports betting market first. Delaware was the first state to legalize sports betting on June 6, 2018, followed by New Jersey on June 14, 2018. West Virginia became the third state to legalize sports betting with the passage of House Bill 4491 on February 28, 2019.

On Wednesday, April 10, 2019, Connecticut Governor Ned Lamont signed Senate Bill No. 9 into law, making Connecticut the fourth state to legalize sports betting. The law will take effect on October 1, 2019.

Under Senate Bill No. 9, Connecticut residents age 21 or older will be able to place bets on professional and collegiate sporting events at licensed racetracks and casinos in the state. The bill authorizes the Connecticut Lottery Corporation to operate a sports betting platform and appoints the Department of Consumer Protection as the regulatory authority for sports betting in Connecticut.

In order to comply with PASPA, which prohibits states from authorizing sports betting except for four states (Delaware, Nevada, Oregon, and Montana), Senate Bill No. 9 includes an extensive regulatory framework that will govern all aspects of sports betting in Connecticut. This framework includes requirements for licensing operators and suppliers; registering players; setting minimum age and identity verification requirements; regulating advertising and marketing; establishing responsible gaming programs; and imposing taxes and fees on operators and players.

The regulatory framework also establishes a “ Sports Wagering Integrity Fund” that will be used to finance efforts by the Department of Consumer Protection to protect the integrity of sportswagering in Connecticut. The Department of Consumer Protection is authorized to promulgate regulations governing operator qualifications, player registration procedures, data retention and security standards, reporting requirements, financial audits, and other matters necessary to implement the law.
