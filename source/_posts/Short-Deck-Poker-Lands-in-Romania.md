# Short Deck Poker Lands in Romania

Short Deck Poker (also known as Six Plus) is a poker variant that is growing in popularity. The game uses a reduced deck of 36 cards, with six card ranks from 2 to 5 and a single wild card.

The game is believed to have originated in Asia, where it is known as Thai Online Poker or Tangkas. It has since gained a following in Europe and the United States, thanks in part to its simplicity and the potential for big wins.

How to Play Short Deck Poker

To begin, each player is dealt five cards face down. The remaining cards are placed face down in the middle of the table, forming the "flop". One at a time, players turn over their cards and make their best five-card poker hand using any combination of their own cards and those on the flop. The player with the best hand takes the pot.

In the event of a tie, the pot is split evenly between the players involved. As in traditional poker, suits are irrelevant for determining rank. A wild card can be used to represent any other card in the deck.

Strategy for Short Deck Poker

Just like in traditional poker, strategy for Short Deck Poker depends on your position at the table, your hand strength, and the action of your opponents. In general, you'll want to play cautiously when you hold bad hands and bet aggressively when you have strong ones. However, since there are only 36 cards in play, there are many more opportunities for making hands than in traditional poker. This means that even mediocre hands can be worth playing if there's a chance that opponents might fold.

# Short Deck Poker Arrives to Fill in the Gaps

It seems that just about every form of poker that can be played has been invented, with the possible exception of Three-card Monte. But even that could be turned into a variant of poker if someone really wanted to try. So it was only a matter of time until someone came up with another variant, and Short Deck Poker is the latest such game to hit the scene.

The genesis of Short Deck Poker is something of a mystery, but the game is thought to have originated in Asia in either Vietnam or China. It quickly spread across Southeast Asia and then to Australia and Europe. The game has also begun making its way into North America, where it is being played by some of the high-stakes players in Las Vegas.

Short Deck Poker is a variation of Texas Hold’em that uses a deck of just 36 cards instead of the standard 52 cards. The 36 cards are made up of six decks, each consisting of six clubs, six diamonds, six hearts, and six spades. Aces are high (Aces are always wild), and two through five are ranked as usual. There is no joker.

The game play is similar to Texas Hold’em, but there are some key differences. For one thing, there are only three betting rounds instead of four. And since there are fewer cards in the deck, there are also fewer hands that can be made. This makes for some different strategic considerations when playing the game.

One other difference is that all suits are equal in rank in Short Deck Poker. So for example, if you have an Ace and a King of Clubs, that would not be a winning hand because an Ace is higher than a King no matter what suit they are from.

# Romania Gets Short Deck Poker

HD Poker, a new Romanian company, has announced the launch of Short Deck Poker. The game is played with 36 cards instead of the standard 52, and is designed to speed up the game and make it more exciting.

Short Deck Poker is similar to Texas Hold’em, but there are some important differences.Firstly, there are only three suits instead of four. This makes it easier to remember which cards are which, and reduces the chances of getting confused. Secondly, there are only six ranked cards instead of seven. This means that straights and flushes are much more powerful, as there are fewer ways to make them.

The game is being marketed as a more exciting alternative to traditional Texas Hold’em. It moves faster and allows for more betting opportunities, making it perfect for casino players who want a more thrilling experience.

Short Deck Poker is already popular in Asia and is starting to gain traction in Europe. HD Poker plans to expand its operations in the coming months and hopes to popularize the game even further.
